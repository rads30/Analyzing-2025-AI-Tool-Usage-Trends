📊 Analyzing 2025 AI Tool Usage Trends
📝 Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize trends in the adoption and usage of AI tools across different categories such as text, image, video, and code.

With the rapid rise of generative AI, organizations and individuals are increasingly relying on these tools — but adoption varies by category, region, and frequency of use.

This project combines data analysis in Python (Kaggle) and visualization in Tableau to provide a clear picture of AI adoption in 2025.

🎯 Objectives

🔍 Highlight the most popular AI tools in 2025

📊 Compare adoption patterns across different categories (text vs. image vs. video vs. code)

⏱️ Understand usage frequency trends (occasional vs. daily usage)

🌍 Provide insights into demographics or regions driving adoption
